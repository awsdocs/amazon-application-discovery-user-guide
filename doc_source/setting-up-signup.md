   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)\.
